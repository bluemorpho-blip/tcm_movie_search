1. some sort of graphic on start-up - ASCII thingy
2. user menu for search choices:
    - start by asking for a month to search:
       I can use the same code-style as I did to add genre.html/ to scraping
       the movie's genre link -> just #{month} to the user's choice
   - title
   - year released
   - genre search
   - actor search
   - director search
      (use a case statement)

3. end search method with return for another search until user enters "exit"

4.  Scraper and search functions in a separate class

Classes
 - Movie Search - where the work between the CLI and the scraper happens
 - CLI -          where the user interacts with the application
 - Scraper -      where the Scraping is happening!
