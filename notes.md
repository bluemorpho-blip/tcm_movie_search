1. some sort of graphic on start-up - ASCII thingy
2. user menu for search choices:
    start by asking for a month to search:
      I can use the same code-style as I did to add genre.html/ to scraping
      the movie's genre link -> just #{month} to the user's choice
    title
    year released
    genre search
    actor search
    director search
    (use a case statement)

3.  Scraper and search functions in a separate class
